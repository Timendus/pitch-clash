# Pitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

This is a dumb little game, written for our one-day browser gamejam.

Gamejam requirements:
  * No frameworks
  * Build in roughly one working day
  * Theme: Don't mix them

The game is played through singing. The higher the pitch you sing, the higher
your ship flies. The lower the pitch, the lower the ship flies. But not all
pitches mix well! Avoid the other player's pitch or you both lose. Try to avoid
the asteroids, because they cost you points, and hit the target on the other
side. Player with the highest score wins! So invite your friends on your
favourite videoconferencing tool and have a blast :)
